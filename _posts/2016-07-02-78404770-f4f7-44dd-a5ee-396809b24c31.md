Artificial Intelligence? ![The only think I can find relating to artificial intelligence is my decision to back The Grid. A year and a few days after becoming Founding Member #48,316, I finally have access to the system which, as it turns out, is still in Beta. -- Beta! Really? That's being kind. More like a gleam of an idea hoping to one day grow up and be worthy of being called a Beta. Sorry, no header, no footer, can't arrange order of posts, no pages, no navigation system. this isn't a website creator. It's a clipping service. Try to upload my own photos. Find the clumsy UI that allows me to turn off auto filters and cropping, and then hit publish or public or whatever bit of magic that makes something hit the page, and there it is, the ugliest damn website I've ever seen. Seems to take hours to publish anything. Hit the wrong button, no I'm not sure which one, and poof. It's gone. Oh well, maybe its early days. Give this another 5 years at this rate and - oh wait, by then the developers have moved on. Artificial Intelligence indeed.](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/33cc048f7abefadd3728e2b708d5b673/noop.gif?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F8bfce3e5-0748-4362-a3d3-75c685ffc21a.gif)
