A year and a few days after becoming Founding Member #48,316, I finally have access to the system which, as it turns out, is still in Beta. -- Beta! Really? That&apos;s being kind. More like a gleam of an idea hoping to one day grow up and be worthy of being called a Beta. Sorry, no header, no footer, can&apos;t arrange order of posts, no pages, no navigation system. this isn&apos;t a website creator. It&apos;s a clipping service. Try to upload my own photos. Find the clumsy UI that allows me to turn off auto filters and cropping, and then hit publish or public or whatever bit of magic that makes something hit the page, and there it is, the ugliest damn website I&apos;ve ever seen. Seems to take hours to publish anything. Hit the wrong button, no I&apos;m not sure which one, and poof. It&apos;s gone. Oh well, maybe its early days. Give this another 5 years at this rate and - oh wait, by then the developers have moved on. Artificial Intelligence indeed.">]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Grid.io builds incredibly slow websites</h1><p>If you're a web designer who uses Facebook, you've probably seen an ad for TheGrid.io, the latest website automation service to hit the scene. The Grid promises total website automation with sleek and modern design. According to sites like TechCrunch, The Grid "uses artificial intelligence to design your websites for you," which sounds cooler than it probably is.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a2337d1b14d04de6318c1a39b75d46701aacf46f.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is The Grid a better web designer than you?</h1><p>Unless you've developed the enviable skill of ignoring adverts on Twitter, you can't have failed to notice The Grid, a new service promising "AI websites that design themselves." The Grid "is not another do-it-yourself website builder," the difference according their site, is that The Grid boasts an advanced AI (artificial intelligence) that can build custom solutions for its clients in mere seconds.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3d62b6ff8dc1f7f9b1010c076dfa33a5/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fnetdna.webdesignerdepot.com%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F12%2Ffeatured1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
